# The Library Management System


A library management system is a software system used to track and manage resources at a library. It typically includes modules for cataloging and 
searching library materials, managing patron information, managing circulation, and providing access to digital resources. It can also provide tools for 
tracking library usage, generating reports, and managing staff tasks. The system helps library staff to more efficiently manage their resources, improve 
access to library materials, and provide better customer service.
